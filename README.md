*a database*

There once was a server.  It held data.  It was easy to use so people used it.  It solved some problems and they were so excited they wanted to use it for everything.  All it does are remember keys that point to values, and maybe some other stuff.  Oh, yeah and it can do transactions.


This isn't that server -- this is just a tribute.
